The following document is aimed at Software Developers who wish to set up a
development environment to work on the UWA Center for the Built Environment
Public Open Spaces Amenities project. The setup procedure described in this
document has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 but will most likely work in most
variants and versions of Ubuntu.

To begin, checkout the project from subversion
svn checkout http://positive-places.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ positive-places-read-only
Since you are reading this document, you have probably already completed this step.

Create a new bash script in the "bin/env" directory of the checkout. The script
should be name "environment_<hostname>.sh" where hostname is the name of your 
machine. You can find out the name of your machine by running
$ echo $HOSTNAME
It is recommended that you simply copy one of the existing environment scripts
and rename it as appropriate.

Edit the environment script and modify the first line that begins with
"export WORKSPACE_HOME". Your workspace home should be the absolute path to 
your subversion checkout.

Setting up the project will require some software to be installed on your
computer. Scripts have been created to automate most of this for you and they
can be found in "bin/setup_scripts". The setup is divided into two phases. 

The first phase, is contained in the script "bin/setup_scripts/setup_ubuntu.sh".
This script will install the following packages:
python-dev 
python-pip 
binutils 
gdal-bin 
libproj-dev 
postgresql-9.1-postgis 
postgresql-server-dev-9.1

The script will also setup a postgis template database called "template_postgis".
If you already have postgres/postgis set up on your computer, it is recommended
that you modify this script so that you do not install multiple versions of
postgres onto your computer.

The project has been configured to expect a postgres password of "postgres". You
may choose any password you like however if you do, you will also need to make
the corresponding adjustment in your django settings file.

To install the Python virtual environment, run the script 
"bin/setup_scripts/setup_dev.sh". This will download the following packages
to your virtual environment.
psycopg2 
coverage 
docutils 
django

If you are running the project for the first time, you will need to create a
spatial database for your data. Run the script "bin/syncdb.sh". This script 
will drop your existing database, create a new database and create the necessary
tables, sequences and indexes.

If you already have a database and simply want to delete all data without
re-creating tables, you can use "bin/flush.sh".

To run the development webserver, use the script "bin/runserver.sh".
To run the django shell, use the script "bin/shell.sh".
